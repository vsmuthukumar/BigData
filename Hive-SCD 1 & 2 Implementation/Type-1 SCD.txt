STEPS TO FOLLOW TO IMPLEMENT TYPE1-SCD IN HIVE
=================================================

1. Two tables need to be used to implement SCD1 type(eg, stg_tbl,final_tbl) in Hive and create those tables.

2. Load/Overwrite the Hive table(stg_tbl) using Sqoop or some other tool.

3. First time, there is no data in final_tbl, now run the below query which will insert/overwrite all the rows from stg_tbl to final_tbl

	-> insert overwrite table final_tbl select * from final_tbl where id not in (select id from stg_tbl) union select * from stg_tbl;

4. Now Load/Overwrite the Hive table(stg_tbl) with only updated data using Sqoop or some other tool. for example intially we have loaded with 4 fours, now all rows are removed from the stg_tbl and load only with the updated 2 rows.

5. Again run the same query , which will take the updates rows from stg_tbl + (all rows from final_tbl - ignoring the rows present in stg_tbl in final_tbl)

	-> insert overwrite table final_tbl select * from final_tbl where id not in (select id from stg_tbl) union select * from stg_tbl;

6.final-tbl now will contains all rows with recent changes data.
